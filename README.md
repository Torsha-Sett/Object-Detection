# Object-Detection
Using different techniques to detect objects



Training a decent deep learning model for object detection takes a lot of effort, which gets compounded when deploying and embedding the model in a web application for end-users. In this tutorial, we intend to tackle this seemingly daunting task by providing a practical example of how to develop an accurate deep learning model using Python and the Tensorflow framework, as well as build a working web application that supports object detection on the fly using the R Shiny framework.
